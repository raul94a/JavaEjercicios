# Java Ejercicios

----
This repository is divided in several package, each one trying to demonstrate interesting Java tools, as Encryption and Multithreading.
## cryptography
* [CaesarCipher](src/cryptography/CaesarCipher.java). Classic Caesar Ciphering.
* [SecureRandomGeneratorExample](src/cryptography/SecureRandomGeneratorExample.java). Secure Random Example.
* [AES Algorithm](src/cryptography/AesAlgorithm.java) AES Algorithm.
* [RSA Algorithm](src/cryptography/RsaAlgorithm.java) RSA Algorithm.
* [ElGamal Algorithm](src/cryptography/ElGamalAlgorithm.java) ElGamal Algorithm.


## threaded_java

Based on java.util.concurrent package

* Threads with `Thread` class.
* Thread States
* Threads with `ExecutorService`
* Timer
* Semaphore
* Hive exercise to practice Threads, synchronization and semaphores.
* ImageProcessor. Applies a grayscale filter to a picture. It usses threads to ensure max performance.
